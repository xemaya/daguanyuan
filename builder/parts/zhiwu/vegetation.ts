/**
 * Vegetation — every plant in Pallet Town.
 *
 * Three ideas carry the whole system:
 *
 *  1. **A tree is a swept spine, not a cylinder.** Trunks are tubes along a
 *     leaning Catmull-Rom curve with a radius function that flares into root
 *     buttresses at the base and tapers to nothing at the crown, plus limbs
 *     grown off the same curve. Canopies are metaball clusters — five to eight
 *     overlapping blobs fused into one skin and then noise-displaced — so the
 *     silhouette is lumpy and asymmetric from every angle. Six species are
 *     generated, then instanced with seeded per-tree scale, yaw, lean and hue.
 *
 *  2. **Foliage is a lighting problem, not a modelling problem.** See
 *     `src/fx/FoliageMaterials.ts`: wrapped diffuse, shadow-correct back-lit
 *     transmission, and interior occlusion baked into vertex colours. A canopy
 *     without those three reads as a painted ball no matter how good its
 *     silhouette is.
 *
 *  3. **The ground is never empty.** Grass, clover, flowers and weeds are
 *     scattered against a baked plantability grid so nothing grows on the path,
 *     the forecourt, the beach, inside a building footprint or below the
 *     waterline — and everything else is dense. The grid is baked once from
 *     `collision.surfaceAt` so the mask can never drift from the terrain
 *     shader's own splat.

 *  - **Where the limbs are.** A tree that forks at 25% of its height and one

   *
   *  - **It is coplanar with the terrain.** 12 mm of separation does not survive
   *    a depth buffer at 40 m of far plane, so every patch z-fought with the turf
   *    and rendered as a dense stipple of interleaved brown and green.
   *  - **It is flat and the ground is not.** The treeline sits on the slope
   *    rising to y ~ 2.6, and a rigid 1.45 m quad on a 15 degree slope buries one
   *    edge and floats the other. What remains above the turf is a
   *    *straight-edged* sliver, so the wood was littered with hard-cornered dark
   *    rectangles that read as scorch marks in a lawn.
   *
   * The fix is the same one the buildings use for their dirt skirts: drape rather
   * than lay. This is a low mound — a radial dome about 12% of its radius high,
   * whose outer ring dives *below* the ground. Nothing is coplanar (every face
   * is tilted, so it catches its own shade and z-fighting is impossible), and the
   * terrain cuts the mound along its curved buried rim rather than across a
   * straight edge, so a patch on a slope reads as litter thinning into grass.
   *
   * The radius is also wobbled per-vertex, so the outline is a lobed blob rather
   * than a circle, and the alpha-cut leaf texture breaks it further.
